# /analyze-opportunity

## Purpose
Evaluate a confirmed structured opportunity record and produce a decision-ready analysis.

## Use When
- `job-opportunity.md` exists
- `intake_status: confirmed`
- You need a pursue / consider / pass recommendation

## Required Inputs
- `/06_Job_Opportunities/<company>_<role>_<date>/job-opportunity.md`

## Validation
Before execution, verify:

- `intake_status: confirmed`
- Required sections exist:
  - Raw Source
  - Structured Extraction

If validation fails:
- STOP execution
- return missing requirements

## Instructions
1. Use `Career/00_Core_OS/Prompts/Packs/opportunity-analysis-pack.md` as the governing workflow.
2. Do not read raw PDFs directly unless the opportunity record is incomplete and the user explicitly asks.
3. Use canonical sources in `02_`–`05_` for evaluation.
4. Score the opportunity using all required dimensions:
   - Role Fit
   - Career Alignment
   - Compensation
   - Company Context
   - Risk
   - Opportunity Value
   - All dimensions MUST be scored (1–5)
5. Produce the analysis artifact in the required structure defined in the Opportunity Analysis Pack.
   - All required sections MUST be present
6. Produce exactly ONE recommendation:
   - pursue
   - consider
   - pass
7. Save output to the same folder as the input file:
   `/06_Job_Opportunities/<opportunity-folder>/analysis.md`

## Failure Handling
- If required context is missing:
  - do not infer
  - explicitly list missing context

## Output
- `analysis.md`
- pursue / consider / pass recommendation

## Runtime IO Emission (Required)
Before finalizing, explicitly emit runtime objects defined in:

- `Career/00_Core_OS/Prompts/Runtime/runtime-io-schema.md`

Required object order:

1. `request`
2. `task`
3. `mode_selection`
4. `routing_output`
5. `context_block`
6. `prompt_object`
7. `output`
8. `validation_result`
9. `artifact_destination`
10. `execution_trace`

Rules:

- Do not skip objects.
- Preserve upstream objects if halted.
- Set `execution_trace.halted_at` and `execution_trace.reason` on failure.
- Do not write artifacts when `validation_result.passed` is `false`.

## Deterministic Conformance Gate (Required)
At end of command run, execute:

- `Career/00_Core_OS/Prompts/Runtime/command-conformance-gate.md`
- `scripts/run_command_gate.sh ".cursor/runtime/analyze-opportunity.runtime-io.yaml"`
- Happy path example: runtime file `.cursor/runtime/analyze-opportunity.runtime-io.yaml` -> run `scripts/run_command_gate.sh ".cursor/runtime/analyze-opportunity.runtime-io.yaml"`

Fail/stop rules:

- If any required gate check fails, STOP finalization.
- Set `validation_result.passed: false`.
- Set `artifact_destination.write_allowed: false`.
- Populate `execution_trace.halted_at` and `execution_trace.reason`.
- Do not write or update artifacts until gate status is `pass`.
